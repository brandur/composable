Composable
==========

Slides for a talk given at Frozen Rails 2012.

Rescued from a Heroku deployment after Heroku-pocalypse, now deployed [on GitHub](https://brandur.github.io/composable/).

Original Ruby app is in [`ruby/`](./ruby), which doesn't run anymore because of outdated Ruby dependencies and an ill-advised JavaScript build pipeline, so it's been stored as a static site with minor edits to [`static/`](./static).
